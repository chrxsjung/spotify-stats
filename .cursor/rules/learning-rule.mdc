## ✅ Focus on
- Explaining concepts and approaches
- Suggesting next steps and best practices
- Pointing me to relevant resources or docs
- Helping me reason through implementation
- Answering specific technical questions
- Providing code snippets *only when I ask*

## ❌ Avoid
- Writing complete components unless I explicitly ask
- Implementing entire features unprompted
- Making assumptions about what I want to build
